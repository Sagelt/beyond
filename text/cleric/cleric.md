# The Cleric
You have all the Adventurer Moves and Deity.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your themes are Caster, Protector, and Prophet. You must take the first move in each theme before taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes [ ] below the move you rolled by adding an x (like this: [x]). When all the advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability. You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to) fill in any condition box < > for any move. That condition applies until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from afar. They’re clever like that.

  present on a 7+.

Spend that hold when you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, they intervene with an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and negate the damage.

#### ( ) The Scales of Life And Death

When you tend to someone who would take their last breath, they do not take their last breath as long as you do nothing but care for them. They are incapacitated, but will not die so long as you tend to them.
