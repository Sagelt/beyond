# The Thief

You have all the Adventurer Moves.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your themes are
[Poisoner](#--poisoner), [Ambusher](#--ambusher), and [Trap
Expert](#--trap-expert). You must take the first move in each theme before
taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to show
you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes [ ] below the move you
rolled by adding an x (like this: [x]). When all the advancement boxes for an
ability are filled in you gain that ability. You may fill advancement boxes in
any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to) fill in
any condition box < > for any move. That condition applies until a move or the
GM tells you to remove a condition.
