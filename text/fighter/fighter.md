# The Fighter

You have all the Adventurer Moves.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your themes are
[Destroyer](#--destroyer), [Bearer](#--bearer), and [Armorer](#--armorer). You
must take the first move in each theme before taking any below it. Indicate
your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes [ ] below the move you
rolled by adding an x (like this: [x]). When all the advancement boxes for an
ability are filled in you gain that ability. You may fill advancement boxes in
any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to) fill in
any condition box < > for any move. That condition applies until a move or the
GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger
When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal
with it and roll+1. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t
come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you
a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Iron Constituion: Take +1 when defying poison, disease, or
  infection.
* [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Battle Hardened: Take +1 when you act through mental
  fortitude.

When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+0. On a 10+,
the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject
relevant to your situation. On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something
interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you
know this?” Tell them the truth, now.

When you have leverage on a GM Character and push them to do what you want,

you. On a 7–9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of
your promise, right now.

### Hack and Slash
When you engage an enemy in melee, roll+2. On a 10+, you deal your damage to
the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6
damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. On a 7–9, you deal your

### Volley
When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+1. On a 10+, you have a
