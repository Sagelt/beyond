# Core Moves

## Last Breath

When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of
Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just roll, +nothing—yeah,
Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are). On a 10+, you’ve cheated
Death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive. On a 7–9, Death himself will
offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black
Gates into whatever fate awaits you. On 6-, your fate is sealed. You’re marked
as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## Make Camp

When you settle in to rest, if you have supplies mark off one supplies. then
choose one for each reserve die you have, then refill your reserve dice to
maximum:

* Roll the reserve die and heal that much HP
* Remove a condition

If you don't have supplies, take a condition instead.

## Take Watch

When you make camp in dangerous territory assign watchers between first,
second, and third watch. If any watcher takes more than one watch they take a
condition for each watch beyond the first. If something approaches camp during
a watch roll+number of watchers. On a 10+, you’re able to wake the camp and
prepare a response, everyone in the camp takes +1 forward. On a 7–9, you react
just a moment too late; your companions in camp are awake but haven’t had time
to prepare. They have weapons and armor but little else. On a miss, whatever
lurks outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.
