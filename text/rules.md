# Rules

This is an abbreviated overview of the rules that attempts to just hit on the
high points to setup playtesting. If something is not covered here, make a best
guess and ask when you get a chance, I'll be happy to expand.

## Moves

The rules of _Beyond_ are broken up into **moves.** Each move says when it
happens and what it does. If a move has you roll the dice, the move will say
what to add to the dice. It might add a modifier specific to that move, or it
might add a bonus based on some condition, or it might ask you a series of
questions to determine what to add.

There are four main categories of moves:

* **Core Moves** are rules for handling common situations like making camp.
  They cover basic parts of life as an adventurer. They apply to everyone. You
  can use one copy of these and pass them around.
* **Adventurer Moves** are the things adventurers do the most, like avoid an
  impending disaster or try to find out what's really going on. Each character
  has them, but each class has different options for how those moves change
  over time. Adventurer moves are printed on each class's character sheet.
* **Class Moves** are specific to each class. They describe things that are
  specific to that class's skill set. They are divided into themes for each
  class. Class moves are printed on each class's character sheet.
* **Supplemental Moves** are groups of moves that come together as part of a
  larger feature. Sometimes these features are tied to one class (only the
  thief has poison mastery), but some are available to multiple classes (divine
  patronage is available to clerics, druids, and bards). Supplemental moves
  come on their own sheets.

Some moves change over time through abilities or conditions. **Abilities** are
ways a move can improve through use. Each ability has a set of advancement
boxes ahead of it. Whenever a character fails a roll, they can check an
advancement box under that move. Once all the advancement boxes for an ability
are checked the character gains that ability. Most abilities modify the move
they are under, but a few give one-time effects when gained and can be gained
again. Abilities are the only way to change a character's bonus to a move.

Abilities are cumulative. For example, a thief has roll+1 to defy danger as
well as abilities that give +1 and +1 against magical effects. A thief with
both of these abilities would roll at +3 against magical effects.

**Conditions** are hindrances to moves that may occur due to failed rolls or
poor choices. Each condition says how it modifies the move it is part of.
Conditions are only removed as part of making camp or through certain magical
means.

## Dice

Many moves say **roll**, which means roll 2 six-sided dice. The move may say to
add or subtract something to the roll (either a fixed bonus or something
depending on the situation). Sum the values on both dice plus any modifiers to
get a total. Each move may be different, but in general:

* A 10+ means it goes as well as could be hoped for.
* A 7-9 means a compromise or worse outcome. You may do what you set out to but
  with a complication or achieve something less than what you intended.
* A 6- means the GM says what happens (and you probably won't like it).

Most moves will have specific results for 10+ and 7-9 but none for a 6-. If a
move doesn't specify what happens on a 6- that just means the GM will say what
happens.

Each player character also has **reserve dice**. Reserve dice are the
character's pool of stamina and will that can push them further. After any 2d6
roll a player may decide to spend a reserve die to roll it and add it to the
total. When a character makes camp they use any unspent reserve dice to recover
HP and remove conditions, then refill their reserve dice to maximum. Each class
says how many reserve dice it gets and how to gain more. Certain moves also
give additional ways to gain or spend reserve dice.

Each class has a **damage die**. When the character does damage with a weapon
they roll their damage die and deal that much damage. If they are using an
especially poor and ill-suited weapon to the attack they are making they roll
twice and take the lower result. If they are using a weapon that is especially
well-crafted or well-suited for the attack they are making they roll twice and
take the higher result.

Some rules refer to a **die size**. The die size is the number of sides on
the die. For example, a d6 has a die size of 6.

## Damage, Armor, And HP

Living things in _Beyond_ have **HP** which indicates how much damage they can
take before facing Death. Something with its maximum HP is unharmed, something
at 0 HP is drawing a last breath. For player characters this means making the
last breath move. For NPCs the GM will describe how they meet Death.

Physical harm is measured in **damage**. When something takes damage it
subtracts that amount from its current HP. For living things the amount of
damage it causes is described by the class (for player characters) or GM rules
(for NPCs). Damage from sources other than living things (like a rock slide or
trap) is based on these options:

* d6 damage for things that are damaging but unlikely to be deadly on their own
* 2d6 damage for things that might outright kill the unprepared
* 3d6 damage for things that might kill even the prepared
* 4d6 damage for things that are very likely to kill

**Armor** is damage mitigation from a shirt of chain, a shield, or scaly flesh.
When a creature with armor takes damage it subtracts its armor from the damage
taken. If the damage is reduced to 0 no HP is lost.

Some damage **ignores armor** entirely, or ignores a specific amount of armor.
This might be because the harm is too broad for armor to be useful (a falling
boulder) or because the attack bypasses the armor.

## Character Change

Characters grow and change through **abilities** and **levels**. Abilities are
gained through **advancement** on a specific move—each time a 6- is rolled on
that move an advancement box is filled and once all advancements for an ability
are filled the ability is gained.

Levels are gained through **XP**. Player characters start at 1st level. At the
end of each session each player reviews the XP conditions for their class and
checks each one that they did that session. Each checked XP condition box is
one XP.

When a player character has time, safety, and XP equal to their current level
+3 they gain a level. When gaining a level they:

* Increase their level by 1.
* Choose a new move from their class. The first move in a theme must be taken
  before any others in that theme.
* Erase all XP.

HP, reserve dice, damage dice, and move bonuses do not change when leveling up
unless the move the player chose during leveling up says so.

## Bonds

Bonds tie the characters to each other directly. Each bond is a statement about
a positive relationship between the characters which drives action. When
creating characters bonds are rolled randomly. For each rolled bond the player
chooses another player character as the target of that bond and asks the player
of that character if they're okay with that bond. If not the player can choose
another target for the bond or the GM can provide an NPC for that bond.

Bonds drive player characters to push themselves, but can also be a
distraction. Each bond has three uses and can be used for each once:

* Gain a reserve die when the target of the bond shows appreciation or
  reciprocation
* Increase the category of success for a roll where the target of the bond is
  affected in a way that relates to the bond
* Decrease the category of success for a roll where the target of the bond is
  affected in a way that relates to the bond

Once a bond has been used for all three of is uses it is resolved. When a bond
is resolved the player can choose one:

* Mark XP for resolving a bond
* Gain a new bond move

If the player chooses a bond move the blank in the bond move (if there is one)
must be filled with the same character who the resolved bond was with.

After a bond is resolved the player chooses a new bond to replace it. They can
either write a new bond of their own, roll for one, or choose one from the
list. The new bond can be with anyone: the same character, a different player
character, or a different NPC.

## Goals

While bonds tie the characters to each other, **goals** tie them together as a
group. The player characters are a party that shares a goal. That goal may be
short term and self-serving (delivering a package across the fire swamp to earn
a living) or long term and selfless (removing the demon incursion from The
Reach) or anything in between. The important aspects of a goal are that:

* The goal matters to all the characters in the party
* Everyone at the table (including the GM) is interested in the goal
* The goal is achievable but not trivial

For the first session the GM will provide a starting goal. As long as everyone
is interested in that goal it stands and drives the first session. If anyone
isn't interested in the goal for any reason revise it as a group until everyone
is interested. If possible it's a good idea for the GM to share the starting
goal ahead of the first session so everyone can review it ahead of sitting down
to play.

Accomplishing goals earns XP for the player characters. When a goal has been
accomplished everyone marks the appropriate XP and then writes a new goal
together.

Goals also help the GM plan adventures and adversaries. More on that later.

## Allegiance

Characters (player characters and NPCs) have an **allegiance** that indicates
an entity or concept that the character is invested in. Allegiances can be to
ideals (like freedom), groups (like The Black Order), or individuals (like The
Queen of Tears).

A character's allegiance guides their actions. Player characters get XP for
serving their allegiance. NPCs use their allegiance as a guide in their
actions.

A player character can change their allegiance through the swear allegiance
core move.

Some moves or magic may reveal a characters' allegiance. The player must
truthfully state their characters' allegiance.

Characters may have affiliations with many organizations and dedications to
many ideals, but their allegiance is their guiding principle and a part of
their identity.

## Gear

Gear is the equipment the player characters carry. Some gear is significant in
itself and is listed individually, the rest of the miscellaneous stuff the
characters carry is called **supplies**. The amount of supplies each class
starts with is the amount they can carry in one slot.

The gear section of each class lists starting gear as well as how many
additional slots to carry gear the class has. Anything significant enough to be
tracked as an individual item takes up a slot. Anything that's insignificant
but maybe still useful can be used as 1 supply.

Supplies include food, rope, grapples, spikes, blankets, flasks, water, or
anything else that might be part of a typical camping kit.

When adventurers make camp they use up 1 supply (eating, drinking, making the
camp site safe and hospitable). If they do not have enough supplies they do not
recover as usual in camp and instead gain a condition.

Adventurers can also use their supplies as a store of useful items. At any time
an adventurer can mark off one supply to grab a useful item from their pack
that would reasonably be part of their kit.

## Coin & The Economy

Money is tracked in coin. Coin is the various currencies that circulate between
the various kingdoms, wildlands, and autonomous areas of _Beyond._

Coin is not king in _Beyond._ While most folk will accept coin, they will do so
grudgingly as coin's only guaranteed use is paying it back to whomever claims to
govern you in taxes. Useful materials or goods, food, art, or favors are all
more directly fungible to most sentient beings.

There will eventually be a section of sample vendors listing what they accept
and what they sell to make this easier for the GM, but it doesn't exist yet.
Sorry!
