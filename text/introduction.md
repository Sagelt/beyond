# Beyond
_A Fantasy Adventure Game By Sage LaTorra_

## Introduction
The world is broken but that’s not the problem. A magical mishap collided the
world with its own past, future, and a few parallel realities. A wizard’s tower
sits atop a nuclear reactor drawing on that power the same way it had drawn on
the ley lines. Giant eagles take to pirating from their new floating roost
aboard an aircraft carrier. Dinosaurs fight for food with owlbears.

Those aren’t really problems, though. People returned to life easily enough,
adapting as people always do. Turns out being a car mechanic isn’t all that
different from repairing magical automatons. The problem is that people have
taken advantage of the upheaval to revel in their greed, power, and gluttony.
It’s the same problem we’ve always had, but now powered by a world in flux.

You set out into this world to do what is right, to protect those who cannot
protect themselves, to test your mettle and better yourself facing those who
would live off the work of others.

## A Fantasy Adventure Game

Beyond is a fantasy adventure game drawing on a long lineage of similar games.
It aims to embrace the parts of the genre that work while also moving it
forward. You’ll need a GM and 3-5 players.

## Quick Start Guide From Dungeon World

Beyond is based on Dungeon World, but it isn’t a new edition of that game. It
considerably shifts the mechanics, procedures, and setting. Since this is a
playtest and is incomplete this section helps fill in the game:  you can just
assume this is Dungeon World except that…

* There are no stats. Each move has its own bonus which advances on its own.
* Rolling a 6- doesn’t grant XP. Instead it grants advancement towards
  abilities on that specific move.
* There are no debilities. Instead there are conditions on each move. Each
  works differently.
* There is no end of session XP. Instead each playbook has its own XP criteria
  which you mark as you do those things.
* There are no moves for being an elf, dwarf, or whatever sentient creature.
  Being an elf, dwarf, or human is just your form, noted on your character
  sheet.
* The core moves are called Adventurer moves and each playbook has their own
  copy of them. The base moves are the same, but each playbook has different
  abilities and conditions for them.
* Bonds now change categories of success (from 6- to 7-9 and from 7-9 to 10+).
  Each time you use the bond you mark advancement on it until you retire the
  bond and gain its ability.
* Each character has reserve dice. Reserve dice can be added to any roll. If a
  reserve die is added to a roll you add the number rolled on the reserve die
  to the total. When you have time to rest and recover you roll all your
  remaining reserve dice and gain HP equal to the total (up to your max), then
  refill your reserve dice to your starting amount.
* Alignment is replaced by allegiance. Allegiance can be to a big concept, like
  Good, or to a specific group, entity, or ideal.
* All the player characters share a goal. The first goal is provided by the GM
  to kick off the game. Once that goal is completed the party writes a new one,
  but they have to agree on it. The goal is what unites this group of people
  beyond their direct bonds to one another.
* Monsters are represented by a single die indicating their strength in the
  current situation. Their damage is equal to that die, their HP is equal to
  the number of sides on that die, and their armor is equal to the number of
  sides divided by 4 (round down).

## Playing Beyond

Each player chooses a playbook. The currently available playbooks are:

* [The Wizard]

The GM provides a starting Goal for the party, then opens the adventure at a
key moment in pursuing that goal.
