# The World

## Extraplanar Forces

Beyond the mortal realm live the inscrutable gods, greedy demons, uncaring fey,
and malignant old ones. Scholars debate if the representatives and bits of
these far realms that mortals have seen are all that there is. Maybe there are
demons who do not prize magic and souls above all else. But from what the
mortal realm has seen these extraplanar forces have singular aims for the
material plane.

The distance between planes of existance is beyond imagining so each of these
extraplanar forces is present but not overwhelming on the material plane. With
time and left unchecked it is likely the material plane with balkanize into
demon outposts and fey-run refuge camps while the gods bicker and the old ones
gleefully promote the chaos and destruction. Mortals are the only thing
standing against this grim future, but mortals are also the ones collaborating
with these destructive forces in return for scraps.

Extraplanar forces are the lurking end to _Beyond,_ the largest threats that
create problems for the players to set goals against. They are exploitive and
uncaring evils that will literally end the world if left unchecked. They
provide the dying light to rage against.

### Demons

Demons come to the mortal realms to pry wealth (as they see it) from the land
and people. They will lay claim to sources of magic and living souls or trade
for them on unequal terms. Their own planes of Hell have been plundered of all
resources by their consuming greed (according to the few mortals to return) so
now they take what they please from the material plane.

Demons are happy to take what they want through any means necessary. They do
not mind taking souls and sources of magic through force, but are also happy to
find collaborators among the mortals and enrich them from the scraps the demons
do not need. There are entire nations propped up by demonic power and enriched
from the gold and material goods the demons capture along with their magic
power and souls.

#### Demonic Intrusions

* A band of demons establish a mine atop a powerful confluence of ley lines,
  shipping the magically charged soil home and causing disturbances in nature
  and in the winds of magic.
* Azaphael, a demon lord, sets out on a hunting party through the mortal realm
  hoping to claim mortal souls to display as a show of wealth.
* A small village begins to take over surrounding land using demon-crafted arms
  and magic items. They bargained their own safety and prosperity in return for
  sending their enemies to Hell, but a demonic bargain is always driven further
  than mortals expect…

### Gods & Angels

The gods of _Beyond_ are both present and obscure. Those favored by the gods
receive their blessings, and miracles are not unheard of. But at the same time
the gods seem capricious and uncaring, pursuing their own agendas which only 
occasionally overlap with those of the mortals that worship them. Even gods
whose domains are ostensibly concerned with mortal life seem to care about 
those mortal lives more as an object to be manipulated than as people.

The angels that serve the gods are fearful creatures of light, eyes, and
feathers. They come in numberless forms but all are strange and hallucinatory
to mortal eyes. They exist only to serve the gods and seem to show no other
thought or purpose leading many theologians to wonder if they are actually
alive or if they are just extensions of the gods themselves.

#### Divine Machinations

* The gods decree their displeasure with the mortals and intend to cleanse a
  portion of the world with a great flood.
* A god takes mortal form leaving their domains unprotected from other gods.
  Unless the now-mortal god can be found and restored to their divine form the
  mortal realm may be thrown into chaos by the divine power grab.
* A god plots to kill another god.

### The Fey Courts

The beautiful Courts of the Fey have little concern for the mortal realms.
Compared to the eternal kingdoms of the Fair Folk the material plane is a
backwater of poor and artless creatures. When the Fey do deign to think of the
mortal realm it is typically to attempt to improve it and save the miserable
souls who must live there, though occasionally a Fey clique will make a
peregrination through the material plane to observe it's pitiable state for
themselves.

#### Meddlesome Interlopers

* In an effort to illustrate to mortals their poor state a fey sorcerer begins
  spreading lycanthropy. "See, it's not really so different, is it? You are
  truly just beasts. Let me help you."
* A clique of Fey take up residence in a forest and begin improving it to be
  more beautiful, upsetting the natural balance and creating strange
  amalgamated creatures.
* Fey artifacts gifted to a local lord to "ease the endless pains of this dark
  place" have strange and unexpected side effects.

### The Old Ones

The Old Ones remember when the mortal realm had not yet been touched by
sentience. They yearn to return the world to its verdant untouched state. The
cacophony of mortal thought and the endless reshaping of the land grate on the
sensory pustules of the great things that live beyond the shadow of the
material plane.

#### Eternal Dreams

* A pseudopod of an old one intrudes into the world causing widespread
  hallucinations and dream-like states among the people and creatures nearby.
* An old one reveals in dreams how they saw the old world leading a queen to a
  self-destructive war to attempt to cleanse the world of sentience (including
  that of herself and her subjects).
* A portion of the world reverts to its ancient state, including invasive
  foliage that overtakes the adjoining land, which leads to panicked and
  displaced creatures venturing into settlements.
