# Introduction

The world is broken but that's not the problem. A magical mishap
collided the world with its own past, future, and a few parallel
realities. A wizard's tower sits atop a nuclear reactor drawing on that
power the same way it had drawn on the ley lines. Giant eagles take to
pirating from their new floating roost aboard an aircraft carrier.
Dinosaurs fight for food with owlbears.

Those aren't really problems, though. People returned to life easily
enough, adapting as people always do. Turns out being a car mechanic
isn't all that different from repairing magical automatons. The problem
is that people have taken advantage of the upheaval to revel in their
greed, power, and gluttony. It's the same problem we've always had, but
now powered by a world in flux.

You set out into this world to do what is right, to protect those who
cannot protect themselves, to test your mettle and better yourself
facing those who would live off the work of others.

## A Fantasy Adventure Game

*Beyond* is a fantasy adventure game drawing on a long lineage of
similar games. It aims to embrace the parts of the genre that work while
also moving it forward. You'll need a GM and 3-5 players.

You can view this playtest version as [a web
page](http://www.latorra.org/beyond/), [PDF](/release/Beyond.pdf), or
the [raw source](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/). You can send
feedback to me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/olde_fortran) or by
[filing an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/issues/new/choose).

Oh, and the name *Beyond* is probably a placeholder. Or maybe not. Who
knows.

### Versioning

Each release of Beyond has a version number of the form xx.yy.zzzzzzzz.
The xx part is the major version. A new major version indicates a
milestone in development. We're currently on major version 0. Major
version 1 will probably be about the point the game is ready for public
playtesting. Major version 2 would probably be some kind of funded
release.

The yy portion is the minor version. Minor versions differ from each
other in ways that are significant enough that you may have to update
characters, choose different moves, etc. You don't necessarily have to
migrate between each minor version, you can jump ahead several at a
time, but you'll need to take some time to review the character
playbooks in particular. Each minor version gets release notes
mentioning significant changes.

The zzzzzzzz portion is the build. Each build differs in mostly editing:
rewordings, clarifications, typo corrections. A build may also add new
moves or playbooks but it won't alter existing moves, playbooks, or
mechanics in an incompatible way. You should be able to move between
builds for the same minor version on the fly.

## Quick Start Guide From Dungeon World

*Beyond* is based on *Dungeon World*, but it isn't a new edition of that
game. It considerably shifts the mechanics, procedures, and setting.
Since this is a playtest and is incomplete this section helps fill in
the game: you can just assume this is *Dungeon* World except that...

-   There are no stats. Each move has its own bonus which advances on
    its own.
-   Rolling a 6- doesn't grant XP. Instead it grants advancement towards
    abilities on that specific move.
-   There are no debilities. Instead there are conditions on each move.
    Each works differently.
-   There can be multiple player characters of each class.
-   There is no end of session move. Instead each playbook has its own
    XP instructions for end of session.
-   There are no moves for being an elf, dwarf, or whatever sentient
    creature. Being an elf, dwarf, or human is just your form, noted on
    your character sheet.
-   The core moves are called adventurer moves and each playbook has
    their own copy of them. The base moves are the same, but each
    playbook has different abilities and conditions for them.
-   Bonds now change categories of success (from 6- to 7-9 and from 7-9
    to 10+). Each time you use the bond you mark advancement on it until
    you retire the bond and gain its ability.
-   Each character has reserve dice. Reserve dice can be added to any
    roll. If a reserve die is added to a roll you add the number rolled
    on the reserve die to the total. When you have time to rest and
    recover you roll all your remaining reserve dice and gain HP equal
    to the total (up to your max), then refill your reserve dice to your
    starting amount.
-   Alignment is replaced by allegiance. Allegiance can be to a big
    concept, like Good, or to a specific group, entity, or ideal.
-   All the player characters share a goal. The first goal is provided
    by the GM to kick off the game. Once that goal is completed the
    party writes a new one, but they have to agree on it. The goal is
    what unites this group of people beyond their direct bonds to one
    another.
-   Monsters are represented by a single die indicating their strength
    in the current situation. Their damage is equal to that die, their
    HP is equal to the number of sides on that die, and their armor is
    equal to the number of sides divided by 4 (round down).
-   The GM's structure is no longer Fronts.
-   The world is a more specific kind of fantasy, a collision of worlds
    and ages.
-   Hirelings, steadings, and many of the more narrow special moves are
    gone.

Other than that, some bits of *Dungeon World* (or in some cases
*Apoclypse World*) remain the same:

-   Rolls are 2d6. On a 7+ the move says what happens. On a 6- the GM
    says what happens (and you probably won't like it) unless the move
    specifically calls out otherwise.
-   Damage is specified by class, not by weapon
-   You have HP. You lose it when you take damage. If you get to 0 you
    take your last breath.

## The World of Beyond

This is a world of collisions. Magic, technology, and myth all live side
by side.

The dominant mode of the world is fantasy. The general shape of the
world is that of a fantasy realm with dragons and dungeons, ruins and
rust monsters, otyughs and owlbears.

Bits, pieces, and people of modern Earth are common. A knight might ride
a motorcycle instead of a charger, a wizard might keep their spells on a
cell phone, an accountant might now be a cleric, &etc. It turns out
adding modern technology to a fantasy realm doesn't change all that
much: electric lights are just as convenient as a rock with *light* cast
on it.

Larger transplants from modern Earth, like a few city blocks, a movie
theater, or an entire town, are frequent. Most everyone knows of at
least one such intrusion within their local area. In these areas the
scenery flips somewhat: instead of bits and pieces and modernity in a
fantasy realm it's small elements of fantasy on a modern city street.

In all cases modern technology continues to work, but it works as magic
instead of as technology. Sure, there's no reliably electricity, but
somehow the winds of magic drive enough electrons around to keep things
functioning (most of the time). There may not be gasoline for that
pickup truck, but it turns out troll spit is just as flamable. In
general any modern technology works as the same concept, but against a
different world: a cell phone app might actually collect stray thoughts
instead of posts, while a movie screen becomes an actual portal to
another realm. Honor the metaphor of what technology does over the
details of how you get AA batteries in a dragon's lair.

Technology is not so uniform as it was in modernity, though. Since it
acts according to the idea of what it is each cell phone might be a
little different: a spellbook for a wizard, a direct line to the gods
for a cleric. A few special items have come through as artifacts,
behaving far beyond what normal items can.

Less commonly other ages of Earth have collided. There's a known bit of
the Western Front still fighting at the edge of a pastoral county. Some
far future technology is said to have manifested deep in a mountain
range.

Rarest of all, elements of other fictions are known to have crossed
over. Telamonian Ajax is a noted adventurer, most recently having
quested into the Castle of the Flaming Skull to find a portal said to
reside there.

Despite all of this, life continues. The actual intrusions are rather
settled and normal. They are more like going to another country than
going to another world. People live their lives as they always have.
Some transplants yearn for home, but in the same way you might yearn for
old friends after moving to a new place. This is a world that is garish
and colorful with odd congruences everywhere.

The problems are what they always are when things change: the greedy,
powerful, and hateful have used this opportunity to further their own
agendas. Nature has been tampered with and harmed. People and places
have been exploited by those who do not care.

The player characters are those who would set to solve problems, to help
the helpless, to build stength from discord. They set out with spell,
prayer, blade, and song to test themselves against the powerful and
unjust. Some adventure because it is right, some adventure because it is
hard, but all will find a world that is not short on dangerous places
and powerful enemies.

## Getting Started

Each player chooses a playbook. The currently available playbooks are:

-   [The Cleric](#the-cleric)
-   [The Fighter](#the-fighter)
-   [The Thief](#the-thief)
-   [The Wizard](#the-wizard)

The GM provides a starting Goal for the party, then opens the adventure
at a key moment in pursuing that goal.

## Rules

This is an abbreviated overview of the rules that attempts to just hit
on the high points to setup playtesting. If something is not covered
here, make a best guess and ask when you get a chance, I'll be happy to
expand.

### Moves

The rules of *Beyond* are broken up into **moves.** Each move says when
it happens and what it does. If a move has you roll the dice, the move
will say what to add to the dice. It might add a modifier specific to
that move, or it might add a bonus based on some condition, or it might
ask you a series of questions to determine what to add.

There are four main categories of moves:

-   **Core Moves** are rules for handling common situations like making
    camp. They cover basic parts of life as an adventurer. They apply to
    everyone. You can use one copy of these and pass them around.
-   **Adventurer Moves** are the things adventurers do the most, like
    avoid an impending disaster or try to find our what's really going
    on. Each character has them, but each class has different options
    for how those moves change over time. Adventurer moves are printed
    on each class's character sheet.
-   **Class Moves** are specific to each class. They describe things
    that are specific to that class's skill set. They are divided into
    themes for each class. Class moves are printed on each class's
    character sheet.
-   **Supplemental Moves** are groups of moves that come together as
    part of a larger feature. Sometimes these features are tied to one
    class (only the thief has poison mastery), but some are available to
    multiple classes (divine patronage is available to clerics, druids,
    and bards). Supplemental moves come on their own sheets.

Some moves change over time through abilities or conditions.
**Abilities** are ways a move can improve through use. Each ability has
a set of advancement boxes ahead of it. Whenever a character fails a
roll, they can check an advancement box under that move. Once all the
advancement boxes for an ability are checked the character gains that
ability. Most abilities modify the move they are under, but a few give
one-time effects when gained and can be gained again. Abilities are the
only way to change a character's bonus to a move.

Abilities are cumulative. For example, a thief has roll+1 to defy danger
as well as abilities that give +1 and +1 against magical effects. A
thief with both of these abilities would roll at +3 against magical
effects.

**Conditions** are hinderances to moves that may occur due to failed
rolls or poor choices. Each condition says how it modifies the move it
is part of. Conditions are only removed as part of making camp or
through certain magical means.

# Core Moves

## Last Breath

When you're dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black
Gates of Death's Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just
roll, +nothing---yeah, Death doesn't care how tough or cool you are). On
a 10+, you've cheated Death---you're in a bad spot but you're still
alive. On a 7--9, Death himself will offer you a bargain. Take it and
stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate
awaits you. On 6-, your fate is sealed. You're marked as Death's own and
you'll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## Make Camp

When you settle in to rest, if you have supplies mark off one supplies.
then choose one for each reserve die you have, then refill your reserve
dice to maximum:

-   Roll the reserve die and heal that much HP
-   Remove a condition

If you don't have supplies, take a condition instead.

## Take Watch

When you make camp in dangerous territory assign watchers between first,
second, and third watch. If any watcher takes more than one watch they
take a condition for each watch beyond the first. If something
approaches camp during a watch roll+number of watchers. On a 10+, you're
able to wake the camp and prepare a response, everyone in the camp takes
+1 forward. On a 7--9, you react just a moment too late; your companions
in camp are awake but haven't had time to prepare. They have weapons and
armor but little else. On a miss, whatever lurks outside the campfire's
light has the drop on you.

# The Cleric

You have all the Adventurer Moves and Deity.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your
themes are [Caster](#--caster), [Protector](#--protector), and
[Prophet](#--prophet). You must take the first move in each theme before
taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to
show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.
You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to)
fill in any condition box \< \> for any move. That condition applies
until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Look

-   Fervent eyes, deep eyes, hazy eyes
-   Vibrant body, old body, trim body
-   Bald, flowing hair, braided hair, styled hair
-   Dwarf, Elf, Human, Halfling, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how
you deal with it and roll+0. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the
threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7--9, you stumble, hesitate, or
flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly
choice.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Worldly: Take +1 when you act through
    wisdom and lore.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] By Faith Sustained: Take +1 when defying
    disease, poison, or magic.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Magical Inversion: When the
    danger you face is magical and you roll a 12+ you can subsume the
    magical power and gain power from it.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Fanatic: When you roll a 9- you must redouble your efforts, no
    matter the cost.
-   \< \> Shaken: -1

### Spout Lore

When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+0. On
a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the
subject relevant to your situation. On a 7--9, the GM will only tell you
something interesting---it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask
you "How do you know this?" Tell them the truth, now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Wise: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Guided By Voices: When you consult the
    voices of the gods in addition to your own knowledge you may improve
    your result one step (6- to 7-9, 7-9 to 10+). The GM will tell you
    the favor the gods ask in return, you may not use this again until
    you fulfill their request.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Dazed: -1

### Discern Realities

When you closely study a situation or person, roll+2. On a 10+, ask the
GM 3 questions from the list below. On a 7--9, ask 1. Either way, take
+1 forward when acting on the answers.

-   What happened here recently?
-   What is about to happen?
-   What should I be on the lookout for?
-   What here is useful or valuable to me?
-   Who's really in control here?
-   What here is not what it appears to be?

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Attentive: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Signs of Belief: No matter the result you
    may also ask "what gods are present here?"
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Strictures: You may also ask "what do this
    person's beliefs want them to do here?"

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Disoriented: -1

### Parley

When you have leverage on a GM Character and push them to do what you
want, roll+0. On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what
they ask of you. On a 7--9, they will do what you ask, but need some
concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] The Voice Of The Gods: When your leverage
    is the manifest will of the gods, take +1.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Stigmata: Take +1 when you have shed your
    own blood on behalf of those you would sway.

### Hack and Slash

When you engage an enemy in melee, roll+0. On a 10+, you deal your
damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may
choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy's attack. On a
7--9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack
against you.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Resilient: On a 6- you take +1 forward
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Warpriest: +1

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Wounded: No matter the result you take 1 damage (in addition
    to any other results).

### Volley

When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll. On a 10+, you
have a clear shot---deal your damage. On a 7--9, choose one (whichever
you choose you deal your damage):

-   You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described
    by the GM
-   You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
-   You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one

## Class Moves

### Deity

You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give
your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak)
and choose your deity's domain:

-   Healing and Restoration
-   The Night Sky And Prophetic Stars
-   Knowledge and Hidden Things
-   The Downtrodden and Forgotten
-   What Lies Beneath
-   The Cycle of Seasons and Time

Choose one precept of your religion:

-   Your religion preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition:
    Suffering
-   Your religion preserves knowledge, add Petition: Gaining Secrets
-   Your religion has important sacrificial rites, add Petition:
    Offering
-   Your religion believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal
    Victory

### ( ) Caster

Gain *[Divine Patronage](#divine-patronage)*.

#### ( ) Penitent

When you take damage and embrace the pain, you may take +1d4 damage
(ignoring armor). If you do, take +1 forward to cast a spell.

#### ( ) Esoteric Beliefs

Choose a Spellbook spell. It counts as a Divine Patronage spell for you.

#### ( ) Turn Undead

When you hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for
protection, roll+2. On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and
brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. On a
10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless
undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act
as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from
afar. They're clever like that.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Banish Undead: You also deal your damage
    to all undead present on a 7+.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Sanctify: On a 7+ the ground you
    stand on up to 10 paces from you is sanctified making it anathema to
    undead. The effects of your turning are permanent on that ground.

##### Conditions

-   \< \> Marked By Death: The undead and spirits are drawn to you for
    revenge or salvation.

### ( ) Protector

When you petition your deity according to the precept of your religion
you get 1 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when
you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, they intervene with
an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a
burst of light) and negate the damage.

#### ( ) The Scales of Life And Death

When you tend to someone who would take their last breath, they do not
take their last breath as long as you do nothing but care for them. They
are incapacitated, but will not die so long as you tend to them.

#### ( ) Divine Protection

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what
it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

#### ( ) Sustained By The Gods

+4 HP

#### ( ) Divine Armor

When you wear no armor or shield you get 3 armor.

### ( ) Prophet

When you petition your deity according to the precept of your religion,
your deity tells you what it would have you do. Take +1 when pursuing
that action.

#### ( ) Faithful

+1 reserve die

#### ( ) Apotheosis

The first time you spend time in prayer as appropriate to your god after
taking this move, choose a feature associated with your deity (rending
claws, wings of sapphire feathers, an all-seeing third eye, etc.). When
you emerge from prayer, you permanently gain that physical feature.

## Bonds

Choose a bond. When your bond applies to a roll you make you or the
target of the bond may increase the result of a roll by one category (6-
to 7-9, 7-9 to 10+) and mark a bond advancement. When all advancements
are marked choose a new bond in place of the one that you completed (but
keep the ability). \* ( ) The gods have an interest in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I
must find out why. \* \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Visions: The gods will
send you visions if \_\_\_\_\_\_ is in danger. \* ( ) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is
in danger but I will keep them safe. \* \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] The
Gods' Work: You may give your reserve dice to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \* ( )
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s faith is strange to me, I can learn much from them \*
\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Expanded Horizons: You may also take moves
from \_\_\_\_\_\_'s class

## Stats

-   8 HP
-   1d6 damage
-   2d6 reserves

## XP

At the end of each session mark those that you did that session. When
you have time to train in safety, if you have marked your level + 3 XP,
erase all XP and gain a level (each mark counts separately).

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Bring peace to a situation
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Serve your allegiance through divine power
-   \[ \]\[ \] Learn about your own faith or a new faith
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Aid someone in need on behalf of the gods
-   \[ \]\[ \] Put your deity before yourself
-   \[ \]\[ \] Achieve a goal

## Allegiance

Choose an allegiance to start with: Common Folk, The Lowlands Church,
The Royalty

## Goal

The GM will give your party a starting goal. When you accomplish that,
set a new goal in collaboration with the other players.

## Gear

-   A blunt melee weapon: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   A holy symbol: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   A sign of faith: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   2 armor of protective gear: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Two healing potions (drink to recover a reserve dice)
-   Supplies (5)

# Divine Patronage

The god have gifted you with magic. Gain the Commune and Cast a Spell
moves.

## Commune

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion
with your deity, you:

-   Lose any spells already granted to you.
-   Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don't
    exceed your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than
    your own level.
-   Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell

When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+2. On a 10+,
the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell,
so you may cast it again. On a 7--9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

-   You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
    tell you how.
-   Your casting distances you from your deity---take -1 ongoing to cast
    a spell until the next time you commune.
-   After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot
    cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Marked: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the
    option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize
    the spells effects or double its targets.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Chosen: The spell \_\_\_\_\_ counts as a
    rote for you.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Devoted Healer: When you heal someone else
    of damage, add your level to the amount of damage healed.

## Spells

### Rotes

#### Light

An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch.
It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like
a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame.
The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

#### Sanctify

Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast this spell is
consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy or unholy, the
affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.

#### Guidance

The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the
direction or course of action your deity would have you take then
disappears. The message is through gesture only; your communication
through this spell is severely limited.

### 1st Level

#### Bless

Your deity smiles upon a combatant of your choice. They take +1 ongoing
so long as battle continues and they stand and fight. While this spell
is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Cure Light Wounds

At your touch wounds scab and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you
touch of 1d6 damage.

#### Cause Fear

Choose a target you can see and a nearby object. The target is afraid of
the object so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to
them: flee, panic, beg, fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1
to cast a spell. You cannot target entities with less than animal
intelligence (magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).

#### Magic Weapon

The weapon you hold while casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss
this spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Sanctuary

As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating
it to your deity. As long as you stay within that area you are alerted
whenever someone acts with malice within the sanctuary (including
entering with harmful intent). Anyone who receives healing within a
sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

#### Speak With Dead

A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions
you pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the
knowledge it gained in death.

# The Fighter

You have all the Adventurer Moves.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your
themes are [Destroyer](#--destroyer), [Bearer](#--bearer), and
[Armorer](#--armorer). You must take the first move in each theme before
taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to
show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.
You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to)
fill in any condition box \< \> for any move. That condition applies
until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Look

-   Steely eyes, fierce eyes, caring eyes
-   Lithe body, ravaged body, brawny body, bulky body
-   Bald, flowing hair, wild hair, styled hair
-   Dwarf, Elf, Human, Halfling, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how
you deal with it and roll+1. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the
threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7--9, you stumble, hesitate, or
flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly
choice.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Iron Constituion: Take +1 when defying

When you draw on a place of power to create a magical effect, tell the
GM what you're trying to achieve. Ritual effects are always possible,
but the GM will give you one to four of the following conditions:

-   It's going to take days/weeks/months.
-   First you must \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
-   You'll need help from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
-   It will require a lot of money
-   The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited
-   You and your allies will risk danger from
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
-   You'll have to disenchant \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to do
    it.

#### ( ) Sustained By Magic

+3 maximum HP.

#### ( ) Enchanter

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what
it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

#### ( ) Self-Powered

When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe space, you can create
your own place of power. Describe to the GM what kind of power it is and
how you're binding it to this place, the GM will tell you one
organization or being that will have an interest in your workings.

### ( ) Warlock

Gain a *[mystic patron](#mystic-patron)*.

#### ( ) Grit

+1 reserve die

#### ( ) Magic Eater

When you absorb a magical effect, roll+1. On a 10+ the effect ends and
you gain a reserve die (even over your maximum). On a 7-9 the effect is
temporarily suspended and you gain a reserve die up to your maximum.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Amplifier: The reserve dice you gain
    through Omega are d8 instead of d6.

## Bonds

Choose a bond. When your bond applies to a roll you make you or the
target of the bond may increase the result of a roll by one category (6-
to 7-9, 7-9 to 10+) and mark a bond advancement. When all advancements
are marked choose a new bond in place of the one that you completed (but
keep the ability).

-   ( ) There is a power in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that I want to understand.
    -   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Expanded Horizons: You may also take
        moves from \_\_\_\_\_\_'s class
-   ( ) I believe an ancient prophecy is about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I must
    protect them.
    -   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Prophetic Visions: When you discern
        realities you may also ask "What will happen if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
        does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"
-   ( ) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can learn much from me, I must teach them
    -   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Mystical Mentorship: You can always
        tell the direction and distance to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Stats

-   4 HP
-   1d4 damage
-   2d6 reserves

## XP

At the end of each session mark those that you did that session. When
you have time to train in safety, if you have marked your level + 3 XP,
erase all XP and gain a level (each mark counts separately).

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Improve your knowledge of magic
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Serve your allegiance through mystical power
-   \[ \]\[ \] Explore a new place of power or plane of existence
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Aid someone in need
-   \[ \]\[ \] Craft a new magic item or develop a new spell
-   \[ \]\[ \] Achieve a goal

## Allegiance

Choose an allegiance to start with: Change, The Blue Order, Power

## Goal

The GM will give your party a starting goal. When you accomplish that,
set a new goal in collaboration with the other players.

## Gear

-   A handheld melee weapon: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   A magical trinket: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   A scrap of lore: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Two healing potions (drink to recover a reserve dice)
-   Supplies (5)

# Spellbook

When you gain a spellbook you get the Prepare Spells and Cast A Spell
moves. Your spellbook starts with 3 1st level spells and all the
cantrips.

## Prepare Spells

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation
of your spellbook, you:

-   Lose any spells you already have prepared.
-   Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total
    levels don't exceed your own level+1.
-   Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast A Spell

When you release a spell you've prepared, roll+2. On a 10+, the spell is
successfully cast and you do not forget the spell---you may cast it
again later. On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

-   You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
    tell you how.
-   The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast---take -1
    ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
-   After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
    again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Trial And Error: Gain a new spell of your
    level or lower, then erase all advancement from this ability.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Master Caster: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the
    option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize
    the spells effects or double its targets.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Leaky Mind: On a hit you always forget the spell, in addition
    to any other choice you have to make.

## Cantrips

### Light

An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch.
It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise
like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the
flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

### Unseen Servant

You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry
items. It can carry anything you could carry with one arm. It cannot
pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items
carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces
behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence
is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the
unseen servant serves you until you end the spell.

### Prestidigitation

You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of
the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool
it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell
without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no
bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly
illusions---they won't fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

## 1st Level

### Contact Spirits

Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull
that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It
is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.

### Detect Magic

One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you
what here is magical.

### Telepathy

You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you
to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have
one telepathic bond at a time.

### Invisibility

Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They're invisible! The spell
persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the
spell is ongoing you can't cast a spell.

### Magic Missile

Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to
one target.

### Alarm

Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells
again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even
if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.

# Mystic Patron

You have the patronage of a mystical entity. You gain the Patron, Dark
Bargain, and Desperate Plea moves.

## Patron

You have a connection to an entity connected to one of the fundamental
forces of magic. Note their name (as best you know it, maybe Palmon, The
Queen of Tears, or Fists-of-Stars) and choose one for each:

-   Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Sign
    -   A dimming of lights
    -   Insects and rodents
    -   An inaudible rumble
    -   A scent of spice
-   Seeming
    -   Glum and gloomy
    -   Cold
    -   Aristocratic
    -   Cruel and uncaring
    -   Joyous
-   Interest
    -   Mortal memories
    -   Souls
    -   Reshaping the world
    -   Sacrifices
-   Powers
    -   Shadows
    -   Creatures of the dark
    -   Flames
    -   Frost

## Dark Bargain

When you tell your patron what you want and make it known you will pay
the GM will name a cost for each that is true:

-   The request is not in your patron's interest
-   The request is hard to accomplish with their powers
-   Your patron is happy with you

Potential costs include:

-   Retrieving something of value
-   Destroying an obstacle
-   Spreading the sign of your patron
-   Causing embarassament to their enemies

## Desparate Plea

When you look to your arcane patron in a moment of need, roll+0. On a
10+ their agenda aligns with yours for the moment: some manifestation of
their power will remove you from danger, at least for the moment. On a
7-9 you are still too useful to lose, but there is a cost: they will
preserve you, but hold 1 over you. Expect them to claim something that
is yours at the worst time. So long as they have hold over you, they
will not answer another desparate plea.
