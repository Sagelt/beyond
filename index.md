# Introduction

The world is broken but that's not the problem. A magical mishap
collided the world with its own past, future, and a few parallel
realities. A wizard's tower sits atop a nuclear reactor drawing on that
power the same way it had drawn on the ley lines. Giant eagles take to
pirating from their new floating roost aboard an aircraft carrier.
Dinosaurs fight for food with owlbears.

Those aren't really problems, though. People returned to life easily
enough, adapting as people always do. Turns out being a car mechanic
isn't all that different from repairing magical automatons. The problem
is that people have taken advantage of the upheaval to revel in their
greed, power, and gluttony. It's the same problem we've always had, but
now powered by a world in flux.

You set out into this world to do what is right, to protect those who
cannot protect themselves, to test your mettle and better yourself
facing those who would live off the work of others.

## A Fantasy Adventure Game

*Beyond* is a fantasy adventure game drawing on a long lineage of
similar games. It aims to embrace the parts of the genre that work while
also moving it forward. You'll need a GM and 3-5 players.

You can view this playtest version as [a web
page](http://www.latorra.org/beyond/), [PDF](/release/Beyond.pdf), or
the [raw source](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/). You can send
feedback to me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/olde_fortran) or by
[filing an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/Sagelt/beyond/issues/new/choose).

Oh, and the name *Beyond* is probably a placeholder. Or maybe not. Who
knows.

### Versioning

Each release of Beyond has a version number of the form xx.yy.zzzzzzzz.
The xx part is the major version. A new major version indicates a
milestone in development. We're currently on major version 0. Major
version 1 will probably be about the point the game is ready for public
playtesting. Major version 2 would probably be some kind of funded
release.

The yy portion is the minor version. Minor versions differ from each
other in ways that are significant enough that you may have to update
characters, choose different moves, etc. You don't necessarily have to
migrate between each minor version, you can jump ahead several at a
time, but you'll need to take some time to review the character classes
in particular. Each minor version gets release notes mentioning
significant changes.

The zzzzzzzz portion is the build. Each build differs in mostly editing:
rewordings, clarifications, typo corrections. A build may also add new
moves or classes but it won't alter existing moves, classes, or
mechanics in an incompatible way. You should be able to move between
builds for the same minor version on the fly.

## The World of Beyond

This is a world of collisions. Magic, technology, and myth all live side
by side.

The dominant mode of the world is fantasy. The general shape of the
world is that of a fantasy realm with dragons and dungeons, ruins and
rust monsters, otyughs and owlbears.

Bits, pieces, and people of modern Earth are common. A knight might ride
a motorcycle instead of a charger, a wizard might keep their spells on a
cell phone, an accountant might now be a cleric, &etc. It turns out
adding modern technology to a fantasy realm doesn't change all that
much: electric lights are just as convenient as a rock with *light* cast
on it.

Larger transplants from modern Earth, like a few city blocks, a movie
theater, or an entire town, are frequent. Most everyone knows of at
least one such intrusion within their local area. In these areas the
scenery flips somewhat: instead of bits and pieces and modernity in a
fantasy realm it's small elements of fantasy on a modern city street.

In all cases modern technology continues to work, but it works as magic
instead of as technology. Sure, there's no reliable electricity, but
somehow the winds of magic drive enough electrons around to keep things
functioning (most of the time). There may not be gasoline for that
pickup truck, but it turns out troll spit is just as flamable. In
general any modern technology works as the same concept, but against a
different world: a cell phone app might actually collect stray thoughts
instead of posts, while a movie screen becomes an actual portal to
another realm. Honor the metaphor of what technology does over the
details of how you get AA batteries in a dragon's lair.

Technology is not so uniform as it was in modernity, though. Since it
acts according to the idea of what it is each cell phone might be a
little different: a spellbook for a wizard, a direct line to the gods
for a cleric. A few special items have come through as artifacts,
behaving far beyond what normal items can.

Less commonly other ages of Earth have collided. There's a known bit of
the Western Front still fighting at the edge of a pastoral county. Some
far future technology is said to have manifested deep in a mountain
range.

Rarest of all, elements of other fictions are known to have crossed
over. Telamonian Ajax is a noted adventurer, most recently having
quested into the Castle of the Flaming Skull to find a portal said to
reside there.

Despite all of this, life continues. The actual intrusions are rather
settled and normal. They are more like going to another country than
going to another world. People live their lives as they always have.
Some transplants yearn for home, but in the same way you might yearn for
old friends after moving to a new place. This is a world that is garish
and colorful with odd congruences everywhere.

The problems are what they always are when things change: the greedy,
powerful, and hateful have used this opportunity to further their own
agendas. Nature has been tampered with and harmed. People and places
have been exploited by those who do not care.

The player characters are those who would set to solve problems, to help
the helpless, to build stength from discord. They set out with spell,
prayer, blade, and song to test themselves against the powerful and
unjust. Some adventure because it is right, some adventure because it is
hard, but all will find a world that is not short on dangerous places
and powerful enemies.

## Quick Start Guide From Dungeon World

*Beyond* is based on *Dungeon World*, but it isn't a new edition of that
game. It considerably shifts the mechanics, procedures, and setting.
Since this is a playtest and is incomplete this section helps fill in
the game: you can just assume this is *Dungeon World* except that...

-   There are no stats. Each move has its own bonus which advances on
    its own.
-   Rolling a 6- doesn't grant XP. Instead it grants advancement towards
    abilities on that specific move.
-   There are no debilities. Instead there are conditions on each move.
    Each works differently.
-   There can be multiple player characters of each class.
-   There is no end of session move. Instead each class has its own XP
    instructions for end of session.
-   There are no moves for being an elf, dwarf, or whatever sentient
    creature. Being an elf, dwarf, or human is just your form, noted on
    your character sheet.
-   The core moves are called adventurer moves and each class has their
    own copy of them. The base moves are the same, but each class has
    different abilities and conditions for them.
-   Bonds are now rolled randomly. Each bond can be used three times
    (once to gain a reserve die, once to improve a roll, and once to
    downgrade a roll) then it is resolved. Resolved bonds grant XP *or*
    special bond moves.
-   Each character has reserve dice. Reserve dice can be added to any
    roll. If a reserve die is added to a roll you add the number rolled
    on the reserve die to the total. When you have time to rest and
    recover you roll all your remaining reserve dice and gain HP equal
    to the total (up to your max), then refill your reserve dice to your
    starting amount.
-   Alignment is replaced by allegiance. Allegiance can be to a big
    concept, like Good, or to a specific group, entity, or ideal.
-   All the player characters share a goal. The first goal is provided
    by the GM to kick off the game. Once that goal is completed the
    party writes a new one, but they have to agree on it. The goal is
    what unites this group of people beyond their direct bonds to one
    another.
-   Monsters are represented by a single die indicating their strength
    in the current situation. Their damage is equal to that die, their
    HP is equal to the number of sides on that die, and their armor is
    equal to the number of sides divided by 4 (round down).
-   The GM's structure is no longer Fronts.
-   The world is a more specific kind of fantasy, a collision of worlds
    and ages.
-   Hirelings, steadings, and many of the more narrow special moves are
    gone.

Other than that, some bits of *Dungeon World* (or in some cases
*Apocalypse World*) remain the same:

-   Rolls are 2d6. On a 7+ the move says what happens. On a 6- the GM
    says what happens (and you probably won't like it) unless the move
    specifically calls out otherwise.
-   Damage is specified by class, not by weapon
-   You have HP. You lose it when you take damage. If you get to 0 you
    take your last breath.

## Getting Started

Each player chooses a class. The currently available class are:

-   [The Cleric](#the-cleric)
-   [The Fighter](#the-fighter)
-   [The Thief](#the-thief)
-   [The Wizard](#the-wizard)

The GM provides a starting Goal for the party, then opens the adventure
at a key moment in pursuing that goal.

# Rules

This is an abbreviated overview of the rules that attempts to just hit
on the high points to setup playtesting. If something is not covered
here, make a best guess and ask when you get a chance, I'll be happy to
expand.

## Moves

The rules of *Beyond* are broken up into **moves.** Each move says when
it happens and what it does. If a move has you roll the dice, the move
will say what to add to the dice. It might add a modifier specific to
that move, or it might add a bonus based on some condition, or it might
ask you a series of questions to determine what to add.

There are four main categories of moves:

-   **Core Moves** are rules for handling common situations like making
    camp. They cover basic parts of life as an adventurer. They apply to
    everyone. You can use one copy of these and pass them around.
-   **Adventurer Moves** are the things adventurers do the most, like
    avoid an impending disaster or try to find out what's really going
    on. Each character has them, but each class has different options
    for how those moves change over time. Adventurer moves are printed
    on each class's character sheet.
-   **Class Moves** are specific to each class. They describe things
    that are specific to that class's skill set. They are divided into
    themes for each class. Class moves are printed on each class's
    character sheet.
-   **Supplemental Moves** are groups of moves that come together as
    part of a larger feature. Sometimes these features are tied to one
    class (only the thief has poison mastery), but some are available to
    multiple classes (divine patronage is available to clerics, druids,
    and bards). Supplemental moves come on their own sheets.

Some moves change over time through abilities or conditions.
**Abilities** are ways a move can improve through use. Each ability has
a set of advancement boxes ahead of it. Whenever a character fails a
roll, they can check an advancement box under that move. Once all the
advancement boxes for an ability are checked the character gains that
ability. Most abilities modify the move they are under, but a few give
one-time effects when gained and can be gained again. Abilities are the
only way to change a character's bonus to a move.

Abilities are cumulative. For example, a thief has roll+1 to defy danger
as well as abilities that give +1 and +1 against magical effects. A
thief with both of these abilities would roll at +3 against magical
effects.

**Conditions** are hindrances to moves that may occur due to failed
rolls or poor choices. Each condition says how it modifies the move it
is part of. Conditions are only removed as part of making camp or
through certain magical means.

## Dice

Many moves say **roll**, which means roll 2 six-sided dice. The move may
say to add or subtract something to the roll (either a fixed bonus or
something depending on the situation). Sum the values on both dice plus
any modifiers to get a total. Each move may be different, but in
general:

-   A 10+ means it goes as well as could be hoped for.
-   A 7-9 means a compromise or worst outcome. You may do what you set
    out to but with a complication or achieve something less than what
    you intended.
-   A 6- means the GM says what happens (and you probably won't like
    it).

Most moves will have specific results for 10+ and 7-9 but none for a 6-.
If a move doesn't specify what happens on a 6- that just means the GM
will say what happens.

Each player character also has **reserve dice**. Reserve dice are the
character's pool of stamina and will that can push them further. After
any 2d6 roll a player may decide to spend a reserve die to roll it and
add it to the total. When a character makes camp they use any unspent
reserve dice to recover HP and remove conditions, then refill their
reserve dice to maximum. Each class says how many reserve dice it gets
and how to gain more. Certain moves also give additional ways to gain or
spend reserve dice.

Each class has a **damage die**. When the character does damage with a
weapon they roll their damage die and deal that much damage. If they are
using an especially poor and ill-suited weapon to the attack they are
making they roll twice and take the lower result. If they are using a
weapon that is especially well-crafted or well-suited for the attack
they are making they roll twice and take the higher result.

Some rules refer to a **die size**. The die size is the number of sides
on the die. For example, a d6 has a die size of 6.

## Damage, Armor, And HP

Living things in *Beyond* have **HP** which indicates how much damage
they can take before facing Death. Something with its maximum HP is
unharmed, something at 0 HP is drawing a last breath. For player
characters this means making the last breath move. For NPCs the GM will
describe how they meet Death.

Physical harm is measured in **damage**. When something takes damage it
subtracts that amount from its current HP. For living thigns the amount
of damage it causes is described by the class (for player characters) or
GM rules (for NPCs). Damage from sources other than living things (like
a rock slide or trap) is based on these options:

-   d6 damage for things that are damaging but unlikely to be deadly on
    their own
-   2d6 damage for things that might outright kill the unprepared
-   3d6 damage for things that might kill even the prepared
-   4d6 damage for things that are very likely to kill

**Armor** is damage mitigation from a shirt of chain, a shield, or scaly
flesh. When a creature with armor takes damage it subtracts its armor
from the damage taken. If the damage is reduced to 0 no HP is lost.

Some damage **ignores armor** entirely, or ignores a specific amount of
armor. This might be because the harm is too broad for armor to be
useful (a falling boulder) or because the attack bypasses the armor.

## Character Change

Characters grow and change through **abilities** and **levels**.
Abilities are gained through **advancement** on a specific move---each
time a 6- is rolled on that move an advancement box is filled and once
all advancements for an ability are filled the ability is gained.

Levels are gained through **XP**. Player characters start at 1st level.
At the end of each session each player reviews the XP conditions for
their class and checks each one that they did that session. Each checked
XP condition box is one XP.

When a player character has time, safety, and XP equal to their current
level +3 they gain a level. When gaining a level they:

-   Increase their level by 1.
-   Choose a new move from their class. The first move in a theme must
    be taken before any others in that theme.
-   Erase all XP.

HP, reserve dice, damage dice, and move bonuses do not change when
leveling up unless the move the player chose during leveling up says so.

## Bonds

Bonds tie the characters to each other directly. Each bond is a
statement about a positive relationship between the characters which
drives action. When creating characters bonds are rolled randomly. For
each rolled bond the player chooses another player character as the
target of that bond and asks the player of that character if they're
okay with that bond. If not the player can choose another target for the
bond or the GM can provide an NPC for that bond.

Bonds drive player characters to push themselves, but can also be a
distraction. Each bond has three uses and can be used for each once:

-   Gain a reserve die when the target of the bond shows appreciation or
    reciprication
-   Increase the category of success for a roll where the target of the
    bond is effected in a way that relates to the bond
-   Decrease the category of success for a roll where the target of the
    bond is effected in a way that relates to the bond

Once a bond has been used for all three it is uses it is resolved. When
a bond is resolved the player can choose one:

-   Mark XP for resolving a bond
-   Gain a new bond move

If the player chooses a bond move the blank in the bond move (if there
is one) must be filled with the same character who the resolved bond was
with.

After a bond is resolved the player chooses a new bond to replace it.
They can either write a new bond of their own, roll for one, or choose
one from the list. The new bond can be with anyone: the same character,
a different player character, or a different NPC.

## Goals

While bonds tie the characters to each other **goals** tie them together
as a group. The player characters are a party that shares a goal. That
goal may be short term and self-serving (delivering a package across the
fire swamp to earn a living) or long term and selfless (removing the
demon incursion from The Reach) or anything in between. The important
aspects of a goal are that:

-   The goal matters to all the characters in the party
-   Everyone at the table (including the GM) is interested in the goal
-   The goal is achievable but not trivial

For the first session the GM will provide a starting goal. As long as
everyone is interested in that goal it stands and drives the first
session. If anyone isn't interested in the goal for any reason revise it
as a group until everyone is interested. If possible it's a good idea
for the GM to share the starting goal ahead of the first session so
everyone can review it ahead of sitting down to play.

Accomplishing goals earns XP for the player characters. When a goal has
been accomplished everyone marks the appropriate XP and then writes a
new goal together.

Goals also help the GM plan adventures and adversaries. More on that
later.

## Allegiance

Characters (player characters and NPCs) have an **allegiance** that
indicates an entity or concept that the character is invested in.
Allegiances can be to ideals (like freedom), groups (like The Black
Order), or individuals (like The Queen of Tears).

A character's allegiance guides their actions. Player characters get XP
for serving their allegiance. NPCs use their allegiance as a guide in
their actions.

A player character can change their allegiance through the swear
allegiance core move.

Some moves or magic may reveal a characters' allegiance. The player must
truthfully state their characters' allegiance.

Characters may have affiliations with many organizations and dedications
to many ideals, but their allegiance is their guiding principle and a
part of their identity.

## Gear

Gear is the equipment the player characters carry. Some gear is
significant in itself and is listed indivudally, the rest of the
miscellaneous stuff the characters carry is called **supplies**. The
amount of supplies each class starts with is the amount they can carry
in one slot.

The gear section of each class lists starting gear as well as how many
additional slots to carry gear the class has. Anything significant
enough to be tracked as an individual item takes up a slot. Anything
that's insignificant but maybe still useful can be used as 1 supply.

Supplies include food, rope, grapples, spikes, blankets, flasks, water,
or anything else that might be part of a typical camping kit.

When adventurers make camp they use up 1 supply (eating, drinking,
making the camp site safe and hospitable). If they do not have enough
supplies they do not recover as usual in camp and instead gain a
condition.

Adventurers can also use their supplies as a store of useful items. At
any time an adventurer can mark off one supply to grab a useful item
from their pack that would reasonably be part of their kit.

## Coin & The Economy

Money is tracked in coin. Coin is the various currencies that circulate
between the various kingdoms, wildlands, and autonomous areas of
*Beyond.*

Coin is not king in *Beyond.* While most folk will accept coin, they
will do so grudginly as coin's only guaranteed use is paying it back to
whomever claims to govern you in taxes. Useful materials or goods, food,
art, or favors are all more directly fungible to most sentient beings.

There will eventually be a section of sample vendors listing what they
accept and what they sell to make this easier for the GM, but it doesn't
exist yet. Sorry!

# The GM

The GM is responsible for everything outside of the player characters.
The players say what their characters say, think, and do. The GM says
everthing else.

## Starting The Game

The GM begins the game with a starting goal for the players. This is
basically a pitch for what the first session will be. Sharing the
starting goal ahead of sitting down to play gives everyone time to
consider and buy in to the goal, but if need be you can just sit down to
play and pitch a goal then. More on goals, adversaries, and how to make
them comes later in this section but here are some ready-to-go starting
goals:

-   Retrieve a mysteriously disappeared wizard's belongings from his
    infested tower and return them to his family.
-   Recover the local relics from a community temple that collapsed into
    an unknown creature's den below it.
-   Track and drive off an expedition of demons that are scouting the
    area for materials and souls to harvest.

Starting goals (or all goals for that matter) don't have to be complex
or creative. What seems direct and obvious to one person may be
unexpected to others. And even the simplest goal may be complicated the
moment the dice hit the table.

## GM Moves

GM moves are ways for you to move the action forward. When someone looks
at you to see what happens you make a **GM move**. When the players roll
a 6- on a move or give you a golden opportunity by putting themselves in
danger you make a **hard GM move.**

Each GM move describes some change that moves the world along and sets
up more action. Hard GM moves are just GM moves made in a way that
offers little or no chance for reaction or mitigation.

For now the set of GM moves is unchanged from DW, but I intend to
revisit this:

-   Use an NPC, force, or adventure location move
-   Reveal an unwelcome truth
-   Show signs of an approaching threat
-   Deal damage
-   Use up their resources
-   Turn their move back on them
-   Separate them
-   Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities
-   Show a downside to their class, form, or gear
-   Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
-   Put someone in a spot
-   Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

## NPCs

Non-player characters do not use the classes or dice like player
characters do. They do not have player moves that require rolling dice,
but they do have HP, armor, and damage.

Each NPC is described by a die size, an allegiance, an instinct, and one
or more GM moves. Some NPCs may also have special rules.

The die size indicates the combat ability of the NPC here and now. It
can change moment to moment as a spell invigorates or a weapon is lost.
HP, armor, and damage are derived from the die size:

-   The NPCs damage is their die
-   The NPCs maximum HP is equal to their die size
-   The NPCs armor is equal to their die size, divided by 4 (rounded
    down)

If an NPC's die size changes their HP changes with it. If they were at
maximum HP before the change their HP becomes the maximum for the new
die size. If they were below maximum and their die size decreased such
that their HP is now over maximum it goes to their new maximum.
Otherwise their current HP does not change.

An NPC's allegiance indicates what or who it serves. When making
long-term plans for an NPC, use its allegiance as guidance. When playing
an NPC that is seeking help or support, look to their allegiance.

An NPC's instinct indicates what goal it pursues in the moment. When
looking for what an NPC will do right here and now use its instinct.

An NPC's GM moves describe any specific ways that it will act out its
instinct or serve its allegiance. Think of them as specific phrasings of
GM moves. "Ensare them in vines" is a more specific version of "put them
in a spot", for example. Having specific moves for an NPC gives you ways
to describe that NPC and their particular skills and abilities.

Some NPCs also have special rules. NPCs don't make player moves, but
they may modify player moves or modify how damage, armor, or other rules
work. For example, lantern goblins have this special rule: "When a
lantern goblin is destroyed it's flame immediately flies to another
lantern goblin if one is present. That lantern goblin increases its die
size."

Non-player characters include any living thing that is not a player
character. Beasts, humanoids, and stranger creatures all use these
rules.

## Forces

**Forces** are the entities and groups that act on the world around the
player characters. They can be large scale, like a kingdom or religious
order, or local, like a sheriff or communal farm. Forces act on the
world to create problems and opportunities for the player characters.

There is no set list of forces. It is up to the GM to identify forces as
they come up and add them to their tracking sheet. A good force:

-   Has resources at its disposal
-   Has goals it is pursuing
-   Has some form of membership or allegiance for those that aid it

Political organizations, trade guilds, military organizations, religious
organizations, and community organizations tend to be good forces. At
times certain powerful individuals, like an ancient dragon plotting
beneath a mountain, can be forces of their own.

The player characters may suggest forces for the GM to add through their
allegiances, bonds, or other aspects of their character. The initial
goal provided by the GM may also suggest forces at play.

Each force is described by a name, area, goal, resources, plots,
opportunities, and moves.

-   Name is what you call it.
-   Area describes the physical domains in which the force has
    influence. Define the area when creating the force, you can change
    it later as needed.
-   Goal is what the force is pursuing. Much like player goals they can
    range in scope and duration, but they should always be a concrete
    outcome. Write one to start with. If that goal is achieved or
    abandoned replace it with a new one or discard the force.
-   Resources are the people, objects, connections, and information the
    force has at its disposal. List 2-3 to start with, then add and
    remove them during play to reflect actions that the players
    undertake or as the result of GM moves.
-   Plots are the activities the force is currently pursuing to further
    its goal. They do not have to be complicated or clandestine, they
    can be as simple and direct as rebuilding a barn or attacking a
    stronghold. If the force is added as part of a goal or adventure
    location make sure it has at least one plot related to that. You can
    add new plots at any time.
-   Opportunities are open weakneses or offered deals that the players
    can take advantage of, defend, or accept. Add them as appropriate
    during play.
-   Moves are GM moves representing common actions the force takes.
    Start with any that come to mind and add more between sessions to
    reflect how the force operates.

Forces stay on your tracking sheet until they either lose their purpose
(no longer having a goal), are soundly defeated, or lose relevancy to
the current action of the game.

Forces are used when planning adventure locations and reviewing the GM
log to create more adventures for the player characters and keep the
world in motion.

## The GM Log

During each session you'll keep a GM log. The goals of your GM log are
to:

-   Keep you focused on the game in the moment
-   Provide a reference of what happened
-   Identify elements to use in planning for future sessions

Your log is made up of entries. Your entries should be as brief as
possible, just enough to remind you of important bits. A sentence or
less most of the time, maybe 3 sentences at most.

There are three types of entries, each indicated by it's own symbol:

-   Events, indicated with a dot ·, describe something significant that
    happened.
-   Notes, indicated with a dash -, are ideas or observations that come
    up during the game.
-   Futures, indicated with a forward point \>, are unresolved threads
    that may lead to new goals, adversaries, and threats.

During each session take notes as they happen. Don't worry about
capturing everything or writing in a way that will make sense to anyone
else. These are your notes to help you plan for the future.

Between sessions review your log from the previous session. Look for:

-   Things that benefit forces in play
    -   Add new resources to those forces to reflect them
-   Things that might drive a force to action
    -   Add new plots for those actions
-   Things that present opportunities to forces or player characters
    -   For opportunities for the player characters, add them as
        opportunities on the force they would impact
    -   For opportunities for forces, add plots to exploit them
-   Important, useful, or dangerous locations the players might want to
    explore
    -   Add these as adventure locations

# The World

## Extraplanar Forces

Beyond the mortal realm live the inscrutable gods, greedy demons,
uncaring fey, and malignant old ones. Scholars debate if the
representatives and bits of these far realms that mortals have seen are
all that there is. Maybe there are demons who do not prize magic and
souls above all else. But from what the mortal realm has seen these
extraplanar forces have singular aims for the material plane.

The distance between planes of existance is beyond imagining so each of
these extraplanar forces is present but not overwhelming on the material
plane. With time and left unchecked it is likely the material plane with
balkanize into demon outposts and fey-run refuge camps while the gods
bicker and the old ones gleefully promote the chaos and destruction.
Mortals are the only thing standing against this grim future, but
mortals are also the ones collaborating with these destructive forces in
return for scraps.

Extraplanar forces are the lurking end to *Beyond,* the largest threats
that create problems for the players to set goals against. They are
exploitive and uncaring evils that will literally end the world if left
unchecked. They provide the dying light to rage against.

### Demons

Demons come to the mortal realms to pry wealth (as they see it) from the
land and people. They will lay claim to sources of magic and living
souls or trade for them on unequal terms. Their own planes of Hell have
been plundered of all resources by their consuming greed (according to
the few mortals to return) so now they take what they please from the
material plane.

Demons are happy to take what they want through any means necessary.
They do not mind taking souls and sources of magic through force, but
are also happy to find collaborators among the mortals and enrich them
from the scraps the demons do not need. There are entire nations propped
up by demonic power and enriched from the gold and material goods the
demons capture along with their magic power and souls.

#### Demonic Intrusions

-   A band of demons establish a mine atop a powerful confluence of ley
    lines, shipping the magically charged soil home and causing
    disturbances in nature and in the winds of magic.
-   Azaphael, a demon lord, sets out on a hunting party through the
    mortal realm hoping to claim mortal souls to display as a show of
    wealth.
-   A small village begins to take over surrounding land using
    demon-crafted arms and magic items. They bargained their own safety
    and prosperity in return for sending their enemies to Hell, but a
    demonic bargain is always driven further than mortals expect...

### Gods & Angels

The gods of *Beyond* are both present and obscure. Those favored by the
gods receive and miracles are not unheard of. But at the same time the
gods seem capricious and uncaring, pursuing their own agendas which only
occasionally overlap with those of the mortals that worship them. Even
gods who's domains are ostensibly concerned with mortal life seem to
care about those mortal lives more as an object to be manipulated than
as people.

The angels that serve the gods are fearful creatures of light, eyes, and
feathers. They come in numberless forms but all are strange and
hallucinatory to mortal eyes. They exist only to serve the gods and seem
to show no other thought or purpose leading many theologians to wonder
if they are actually alive or if they are just extensions of the gods
themselves.

#### Divine Machinations

-   The gods decree their displeasure with the mortals and intend to
    cleanse a portion of the world with a great flood.
-   A god takes mortal form leaving their domains unprotected from other
    gods. Unless the now-mortal god can be found and restored to their
    divine form the mortal realm may be thrown into chaos by the divine
    power grab.
-   A god plots to kill another god.

### The Fey Courts

The beautiful Courts of the Fey have little concern for the mortal
realms. Compared to the eternal kingdoms of the Fair Folk the material
plane is a backwater of poor and artless creatures. When the Fey do
deign to think of the mortal realm it is typically to attempt to improve
it and save the miserable souls who must live there, though occasionally
a Fey clique will make a peregrination through the material plane to
observe it's pitiable state for themselves.

#### Courtly Intrigues

-   In an effort to illustrate to mortals their poor state a fey
    sorcerer begins spreading lycanthropy. "See, it's not really so
    different, is it? You are truly just beasts. Let me help you."
-   A clique of Fey take up residence in a forest and begin improving it
    to be more beautiful, upsetting the natural balance and creating
    strange amalgamated creatures.
-   Fey artifacts gifted to a local lord to "ease the endless pains of
    this dark place" have strange and unexpected side effects.

### The Old Ones

The Old Ones remember when the mortal realm had not yet been touched by
sentience. They yearn to return the world to its verdant untouched
state. The cacophony of mortal thought and the endless reshaping of the
land grate on the sensory pustules of the great things that live beyond
the shadow of the material plane.

#### Eternal Dreams

-   A pseudopod of an old one intrudes into the world causing widespread
    hallucinations and dream-like states among the people and creatures
    nearby.
-   An old one reveals in dreams how they saw the old world leading a
    queen to a self-destructive war to attempt to cleanse the world of
    sentience (including that of herself and her subjects).
-   A portion of the world reverts to its ancient state, including
    invasive foliage that overtakes the adjoining land, which leads to
    paniced and displaced creatures venturing into settlements.

# Core Moves

## Last Breath

When you're dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black
Gates of Death's Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just
roll, +nothing---yeah, Death doesn't care how tough or cool you are). On
a 10+, you've cheated Death---you're in a bad spot but you're still
alive. On a 7--9, Death himself will offer you a bargain. Take it and
stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate
awaits you. On 6-, your fate is sealed. You're marked as Death's own and
you'll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## Make Camp

When you settle in to rest, if you have supplies mark off one supplies.
then choose one for each reserve die you have, then refill your reserve
dice to maximum:

-   Roll the reserve die and heal that much HP
-   Remove a condition

If you don't have supplies, take a condition instead.

## Take Watch

When you make camp in dangerous territory assign watchers between first,
second, and third watch. If any watcher takes more than one watch they
take a condition for each watch beyond the first. If something
approaches camp during a watch roll+number of watchers. On a 10+, you're
able to wake the camp and prepare a response, everyone in the camp takes
+1 forward. On a 7--9, you react just a moment too late; your companions
in camp are awake but haven't had time to prepare. They have weapons and
armor but little else. On a miss, whatever lurks outside the campfire's
light has the drop on you.

## Swear Allegiance

When you swear allegiance say how you renounce your old allegiance and
make a formal pledge to your new allegiance. Remove your old allegiance
and erase any XP you had for any XP conditions that relied on your
allegiance. Write in your new allegiance.

# The Cleric

You have all the Adventurer Moves and Deity.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your
themes are [Caster](#--caster), [Protector](#--protector), and
[Prophet](#--prophet). You must take the first move in each theme before
taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x: (x) to
show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.
You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to)
fill in any condition box \< \> for any move. That condition applies
until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Look

-   Fervent eyes, deep eyes, hazy eyes

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how
you deal with it and roll+0. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the
threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7--9, you stumble, hesitate, or
flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly
choice.

**Abilities**

    wisdom and lore.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] By Faith Sustained: Take +1 when defying
    disease, poison, or magic.

    magical power and gain power from it.

    matter the cost.

### Spout Lore

something interesting---it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask
you "How do you know this?" Tell them the truth, now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Wise: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Guided By Voices: When you consult the
    voices of the gods in addition to your own knowledge you may improve

    the favor the gods ask in return, you may not use this again until
    you fulfill their request.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Dazed: -1

### Discern Realities

When you closely study a situation or person, roll+2. On a 10+, ask the

-   What is about to happen?

    person's beliefs want them to do here?"

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Disoriented: -1

### Parley

When you have leverage on a GM Character and push them to do what you
want, roll+0. On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what
they ask of you. On a 7--9, they will do what you ask, but need some
concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] The Voice Of The Gods: When your leverage
    is the manifest will of the gods, take +1.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Stigmata: Take +1 when you have shed your
    own blood on behalf of those you would sway.

### Hack and Slash

When you engage an enemy in melee, roll+0. On a 10+, you deal your
damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may
choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy's attack. On a

against you.

you choose you deal your damage):

-   You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described
    by the GM
-   You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
-   You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one

## Class Moves

your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak)
and choose your deity's domain:

-   Healing and Restoration
-   The Night Sky And Prophetic Stars
-   Knowledge and Hidden Things
-   The Downtrodden and Forgotten

### ( ) Caster

Gain *[Divine Patronage](#divine-patronage)*.

#### ( ) Penitent

(ignoring armor). If you do, take +1 forward to cast a spell.

#### ( ) Esoteric Beliefs

Choose a Spellbook spell. It counts as a Divine Patronage spell for you.

#### ( ) Turn Undead

When you hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for
protection, roll+2. On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and
brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. On a
10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless
undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act
as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from
afar. They're clever like that.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Banish Undead: You also deal your damage
    to all undead present on a 7+.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Sanctify: On a 7+ the ground you
    stand on up to 10 paces from you is sanctified making it anathema to
    undead. The effects of your turning are permanent on that ground.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Marked By Death: The undead and spirits are drawn to you for
    revenge or salvation.

### ( ) Protector

When you petition your deity according to the precept of your religion
you get 1 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that hold when
you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, they intervene with
an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a
burst of light) and negate the damage.

#### ( ) The Scales of Life And Death

When you tend to someone who would take their last breath, they do not
take their last breath as long as you do nothing but care for them. They
are incapacitated, but will not die so long as you tend to them.

#### ( ) Divine Protection

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what
it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

#### ( ) Sustained By The Gods

+4 HP

#### ( ) Divine Armor

When you wear no armor or shield you get 3 armor.

claws, wings of sapphire feathers, an all-seeing third eye, etc.). When

# Divine Patronage

The god have gifted you with magic. Gain the Commune and Cast a Spell
moves.

## Commune

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion
with your deity, you:

-   Lose any spells already granted to you.
-   Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don't
    exceed your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than
    your own level.
-   Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell

When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+2. On a 10+,
the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell,
so you may cast it again. On a 7--9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

-   You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
    tell you how.
-   Your casting distances you from your deity---take -1 ongoing to cast
    a spell until the next time you commune.
-   After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot
    cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

### Abilities

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Marked: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the
    option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize
    the spells effects or double its targets.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Chosen: The spell \_\_\_\_\_ counts as a
    rote for you.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Devoted Healer: When you heal someone else
    of damage, add your level to the amount of damage healed.

## Spells

### Rotes

#### Light

An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch.
It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like
a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame.
The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

#### Sanctify

Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast this spell is
consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy or unholy, the
affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.

#### Guidance

The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the
direction or course of action your deity would have you take then
disappears. The message is through gesture only; your communication
through this spell is severely limited.

### 1st Level

#### Bless

Your deity smiles upon a combatant of your choice. They take +1 ongoing
so long as battle continues and they stand and fight. While this spell
is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Cure Light Wounds

At your touch wounds scab and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you
touch of 1d6 damage.

#### Cause Fear

Choose a target you can see and a nearby object. The target is afraid of
the object so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to
them: flee, panic, beg, fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1
to cast a spell. You cannot target entities with less than animal
intelligence (magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).

#### Magic Weapon

The weapon you hold while casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss
this spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Sanctuary

As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating
it to your deity. As long as you stay within that area you are alerted
whenever someone acts with malice within the sanctuary (including
entering with harmful intent). Anyone who receives healing within a
sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

#### Speak With Dead

A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions
you pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the
knowledge it gained in death.

# The Fighter

You have all the Adventurer Moves.

Choose three class moves to start with from among your themes. Your
themes are [Destroyer](#--destroyer), [Bearer](#--bearer), and
[Armorer](#--armorer). You must take the first move in each theme before

show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.

# Signature Weapon

Your signature weapon is one of a kind. It may be important in some
universal way (an heirloom or enchanted weapon) or only important to
you, but it is yours through and through. Nothing can separate you from
it for long. Describe your weapon from the lists below.

# The Thief

themes are [Poisoner](#--poisoner), [Ambusher](#--ambusher), and [Trap
Expert](#--trap-expert). You must take the first move in each theme
before taking any below it. Indicate your move by marking it (put an x:
(x) to show you have the move).

When you roll a 6-, mark one of the advancement boxes \[ \] below the
move you rolled by adding an x (like this: \[x\]). When all the
advancement boxes for an ability are filled in you gain that ability.
You may fill advancement boxes in any order you like.

When you take a condition (when a move says to or when the GM says to)
fill in any condition box \< \> for any move. That condition applies
until a move or the GM tells you to remove a condition.

## Adventurer Moves

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how
you deal with it and roll+1. On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the
threat doesn't come to bear. On a 7--9, you stumble, hesitate, or
flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly
choice.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Danger Sense: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Immunity: Take +1 when defying poison,
    disease, or infection.

    traps or ambushes.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Spellthief: Take +1 against magical
    effects.

    you a better outcome, true beauty, or a moment of grace.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Shaken: -1

### Spout Lore

When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+1. On
a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the
subject relevant to your situation. On a 7--9, the GM will only tell you
something interesting---it's on you to make it useful. The GM might ask
you "How do you know this?" Tell them the truth, now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Exploit: Take +1 forward when acting on
    the information.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Disoriented: -1

### Parley

When you have leverage on a GM Character and push them to do what you
want, roll+1. On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what
they ask of you. On a 7--9, they will do what you ask, but need some
concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Wealth and Taste: When you make a show of
    your wealth and taste take +1

### Hack and Slash

When you engage an enemy in melee, roll+0. On a 10+, you deal your
damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may
choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy's attack. On a
7--9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack
against you.

**Abilities**

    unsuspecting targets.

have a clear shot---deal your damage. On a 7--9, choose one (whichever
you choose you deal your damage):

-   You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described
    by the GM
-   You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
-   You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Kill Shot: You deal +1d4 damage
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Strong Arm, True Aim: You can throw any
    melee weapon, using it to volley. A thrown melee weapon is gone; you
    can never choose to reduce ammo on a 7--9.

## Class Moves

### ( ) Poisoner

You have a *[poison mastery](#poison-mastery)*.

#### ( ) Disguise

When you have time and materials you can create a disguise that will
fool anyone into thinking you're another creature of about the same size

poison to your attacker.

    immediately conceal yourself again, your target will know they were
    attacked but not by whom or where you are.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Slowed: You always end up in melee after an ambush.

#### ( ) Shoot First

You're never caught by surprise. When an enemy would get the drop on
you, you get to act first instead.

#### ( ) Surge

+1 reserve die.

#### ( ) Escape Route

When you're in too deep and need a way out, name your escape route and
roll+2. On a 10+ you're gone. On a 7--9 you can stay or go, but if you
go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the
GM will tell you what.

### ( ) Trap Expert

When you spend a moment to survey a dangerous area, roll+2. On a 10+ the
GM will tell you the location and trigger of the nearest trap (or let

the location or trigger of the nearest trap, your choice.

two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Subtle: On a 7+ you leave no trace of your
    tampering.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Practiced: +1

#### ( ) Connections

When you put out word to the criminal underbelly about something you
want or need, roll+1. On a 10+, someone has it, just for you. On a 7--9,
you'll have to settle for something close or it comes with strings
attached, your call.

# Spellbook

When you gain a spellbook you get the Prepare Spells and Cast A Spell
moves. Your spellbook starts with 3 1st level spells and all the
cantrips.

## Prepare Spells

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation
of your spellbook, you:

-   Lose any spells you already have prepared.
-   Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total
    levels don't exceed your own level+1.
-   Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast A Spell

When you release a spell you've prepared, roll+2. On a 10+, the spell is
successfully cast and you do not forget the spell---you may cast it
again later. On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

-   You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
    tell you how.
-   The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast---take -1
    ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
-   After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
    again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

**Abilities**

-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Trial And Error: Gain a new spell of your
    level or lower, then erase all advancement from this ability.
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Master Caster: +1
-   \[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \]\[ \] Empower Magic: On a 10+ you have the
    option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may maximize
    the spells effects or double its targets.

**Conditions**

-   \< \> Leaky Mind: On a hit you always forget the spell, in addition
    to any other choice you have to make.

## Cantrips

### Light

An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch.
It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise
like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the
flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

### Unseen Servant

You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry
items. It can carry anything you could carry with one arm. It cannot
pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items
carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces
behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence
is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the
unseen servant serves you until you end the spell.

### Prestidigitation

You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of
the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool
it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell
without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no
bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly
illusions---they won't fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

## 1st Level

### Contact Spirits

Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull
that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It
is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.

### Detect Magic

One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you
what here is magical.

### Telepathy

You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you
to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have
one telepathic bond at a time.

### Invisibility

Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They're invisible! The spell
persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the
spell is ongoing you can't cast a spell.

### Magic Missile

Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to
one target.

### Alarm

Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells
again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even
if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.

# Mystic Patron

You have the patronage of a mystical entity. You gain the Patron, Dark
Bargain, Desperate Plea, and Bane moves. You may also replace any of
your current bonds with bonds to your patron.

## Patron

You have a connection to an entity connected to one of the fundamental
forces of magic. Note their name (as best you know it, maybe Palmon, The
Queen of Tears, or Fists-of-Stars) and choose one for each:

-   Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Dark Bargain

When you tell your patron what you want and make it known you will pay
the GM will name a cost for each that is true:

-   The request is not in your patron's interest
-   The request is hard to accomplish with their powers
-   Your patron is happy with you

Potential costs include:

-   Retrieving something of value
-   Destroying an obstacle
-   Spreading the sign of your patron
-   Causing embarassament to their enemies

## Desparate Plea

When you look to your arcane patron in a moment of need, roll+bonds with
your patron. On a 10+ their agenda aligns with yours for the moment:
some manifestation of their power will remove you from danger, at least
for the moment. On a 7-9 you are still too useful to lose, but there is
a cost: they will preserve you, but hold 1 over you. Expect them to
claim something that is yours at the worst time. So long as they have
hold over you, they will not answer another desparate plea.

## Bane

When you channel your patron's power into a blast roll+bonds with your
patron. On a hit you deal 1d6 damage or hinder the target giving +1
forward to you or an ally acting against them. On a 7-9 you consume
something of value to you (1 HP, 1 supply, 1 XP, 1 advancement).
